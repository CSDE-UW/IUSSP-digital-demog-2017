## Resources

These are additional resources you may find useful as you continue to learn
about R and about digital demographic methods. R has a generous and welcoming
community of users, and they have made many materials for learners available
freely online.

Charles Lanfear teaches a 10-week course at the University of Washington
called Introduction to R for Social Scientists. The slides and recorded
videos of his lectures are publicly available on his course website:
https://clanfear.github.io/CSSS508/

*R for Data Science* is a focused and clearly-written introduction to
working with R by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. These authors
have also written other books you may find helpful. The entire book
is available freely at this website: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/

Kieran Healy's new book, *Data Visualization for Social Science*, introduces
you to principles of good graphics and to plotting in R using `ggplot2`.
It is available online at this website: http://socviz.co/

If you are interested in working with text data and continuing to do
sentiment analysis, a helpful book is *Text Mining with R*, by Julia Silge
and David Robinson. Their [chapter on sentiment analysis](http://tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html#the-sentiments-dataset)
describes three different common dictionaries for sentiment in English-language
texts. The book is online at this website: http://tidytextmining.com/

All of the above resources are free. We have typically found these types of
resources to be more than adequate for our own learning and teaching. However,
you might prefer to use more interactive or elaborate learning materials. In
that case, one *paid* resource for learning data science in R online is
[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). Some university departments in the
United States use their courses as additional materials for teaching students R.
You can try out one of their courses, [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r),
for free, to see if you prefer that style of teaching and learning.
